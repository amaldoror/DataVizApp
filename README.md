# DataVizApp

## Project Overview

### Objectives:
1. Develop a user-friendly Streamlit app for data visualization.
2. Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics.
3. Enable AI-based interaction for querying and understanding the data and results.

### Main Features:
1. **Data Upload and Preview**
2. **Data Visualization**
3. **Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation**
4. **AI-based Q&A**

## Project Outline

### 1. Project Initialization
- Set up the project structure.
- Install required libraries.

### 2. User Interface Design
- Design a clean and intuitive user interface using Streamlit.

### 3. Data Handling
- Implement file upload functionality.
- Support for multiple file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF).

### 4. Data Visualization
- Provide multiple chart types (line, bar, area).
- Enable interactive visualizations.

### 5. Machine Learning Integration
- Preprocess data for training.
- Implement multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).
- Display model training results and evaluation metrics.

### 6. AI Interaction
- Integrate an AI chat interface.
- Allow users to ask questions about the data and results.

### 7. Testing and Deployment
